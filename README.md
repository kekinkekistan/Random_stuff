yes for the baldursgate saves; 
on linux, go to home directory .local/share/baldursgate/saves and paste it *
on windows documents/baldursgate/saves



* in there OR copy your save into /mpsaves (while saving on that game save to later have it run on saves folder, you remove the copy from /saves to then paste in the save from /mpsaves into /save. [this is to remove any potential bugs]

also a bit hype, havent read any about bg3 but i hope they also will allow to import ones char.
